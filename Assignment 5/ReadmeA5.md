• Did you learn anything new about the human’s freedom?
  - No
• How many categories of freedom (clusters) have you defined?
  - 3
• Which clustering methods and algorithms have you implemented?
  - K-Means Algorithm
• What motivates your choice of algorithms?
  - Because K-means is really good when comparing raw numbers.
• What are the advantages and disadvantages of these methods?
  - Advantages
    □ Simple
    □ Effective – always gives solution (not always good enough ;)
    □ Efficient – quick
  - Disadvantages
    □ Good for compact clusters only, sensitive with outliers and noise
    □ Uses numeric data only
    □ Features should have similar measure scale
    □ Difficult to estimate the quality
• Would you be able to re-use the code of your solution for analysis of data
collected in previous years? How?
  - Yes, we would just have to change the specific year in our calculations.
