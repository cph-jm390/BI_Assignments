This is the readme for assignment 3

I primarily made linear regression, but started on poly on some of the values
The biggest challenges for this was to get streamlit to work properly, most likely because of a seperate environment in anaconda, and to get a feel of how much data the .py file reads and deploys (for example the dataframes!) 

It was hard to get the r2 value to be really close to 1 trying to look into relevant data as well, but I ended up with just about 0,6. For now I am happy with that but would like to look more into it, possibly reflect more upon some of the values in real life scenarios while looking at the data.
That might give a better idea of how to raise the r2 value. 

On top of that, I would like to sit down at work out the .py file to show correct diagrams, but I got the basic idea now how to make it work so it doesn't seem like the biggest mouthfull. Right now the deployed version is filled with a row of 7 scatter plots x 7 (as it refers to the same plt throughout the document)

The last thing I would like to look more into is smoothening the poly graphs.

Overall I learnt a lot from the project which I am extremely happy with
